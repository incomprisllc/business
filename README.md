# 🌀 Incompris LLC – Business & Honor Agreements

**Welcome to the inner sanctum of Incompris LLC.**  
This repo exists as a sacred space for organizing the business-side of our artistry — including revenue splits, honor agreements, contribution types, and creative attributions. It is both a living archive and a humble contract with the future.

---

## ✨ Philosophy

Incompris LLC operates on the principle that **art is soulwork**, and soulwork deserves to be honored — even before it generates profit.

This space is designed to:

- Document meaningful collaborations, inspirations, and co-creations.
- Ensure fair splits through platforms like [DistroKid](https://distrokid.com/), [Songtrust](https://songtrust.com/), and more.
- Serve as a placeholder for formal contracts that may be developed in the future.
- Embed transparency, gratitude, and values-aligned structure into the foundation of our music business.

## 📜 Honor Agreements

Honor agreements are lightweight, intention-based placeholders for formal contracts. They:

- Acknowledge emotional, creative, or energetic contributions to a song.
- Define the role (e.g. *Co-Writer*, *Inspiration*, *Featured Artist*).
- Include a proposed split percentage (💰) — even if revenue = $0 today.
- Are rooted in **values over legality** — integrity now, scale later.

> _"The song wouldn't have existed without you. That deserves something — even if it's just acknowledgment."_ 💫

## 🧠 Why This Exists

This repo is about more than money. It’s about making sure the love, pain, and magic that fuels our creative process gets remembered and respected — even if the world never hears the song.

It’s about trust, integrity, and future-proofing.  
It’s about **honoring the moment and the people who shaped it.**
