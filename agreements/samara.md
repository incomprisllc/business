# 🤍 Honor Agreement – Samara  
_A symbolic agreement of gratitude, energy, and future equity_

---

## 🧭 Purpose & Intention

This agreement is a **non-binding placeholder** used by `.play()` and **Incompris LLC** to acknowledge and honor your deep impact on this body of work.

It exists to reflect:

- 🫂 The **emotional, energetic, and creative presence** you brought into my life
- 🔁 The **reciprocity** I want to build into my music and my world
- 🌱 The **scalability** of soul-aligned art as it grows over time

You didn’t just inspire me—you **activated** something in me. That deserves to be etched into the foundation of this art.

## 🧘 Final Note

This isn’t about money. This is about **truth**, **beauty**, and **honoring where the music came from**.

If these songs ever go anywhere, I want them to carry you with them.  
Not because you asked.  
Because it’s **right**.

Thank you for showing up exactly how you did. You’ll always be part of this.
