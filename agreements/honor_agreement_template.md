# 🌱 Incompris Honor Agreement Template  
_A living placeholder for future royalty splits & creative credit_

---

## 🧭 Purpose & Intention

This agreement is **not** a legal contract. It is a **symbol of respect, intention, and alignment**, used by `.play()` and collaborators under **Incompris LLC** to acknowledge meaningful contributions to the creative process—whether emotional, inspirational, or collaborative.

It is designed to reflect:
- 🌱 The **spiritual & emotional origin** of a piece
- 🔮 The **potential for future value**
- 🤝 A mutual **ethics-first mindset** around art, growth, and reciprocity

> _“If this music grows, we grow together.”_

## 📬 What I Need From You

In order to set you up as a royalty participant (via DistroKid, SoundCloud splits, or other future platforms), I’ll eventually need:

- An **email address** to receive royalties
- Your **name or pseudonym**
- (Optional) A **PayPal or payment account** for direct support

Please note: **This is not a promise of income.** It’s a setup for potential growth and honor of contribution.

## 🧘 Final Note

This is a **living document**, not a final word.  
It's a seed of trust, not a binding chain.  
If we ever revisit this, it will be with transparency, compassion, and care.

Until then, thank you for being a part of my story.
